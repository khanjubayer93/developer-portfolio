                <p>I am a web developer and web designer, how do I get new customers?
                    I find this very very hard though my clients love my work and have recommended me.
                    Believe me, people are looking for good web dev/design people. Here's some thoughts:
                    Make sure you have a really solid understanding of your strengths and weaknesses.
                    Are you more creative or better at HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP...?
                    Are you a good project manager or do you work better on a team that has someone responsible for
                    project
                    management?
                    Nobody is good at everything. It is OK to have weaknesses as long as you are aware of them.

                <p>The simplest one that may come to mind is to ask around. There are always a few folks that may need
                    some
                    help with websites.
                    LIkely friends have family members that have
                    an existing website or are in need of one - so letting them know you
                    may be of help can help you get a lead or two here and there, and get more experience.
                    There are advertising agencies that have clients that need help with making websites/landing pages
                    or
                    building new ones.
                    If you have your portfolio ready - get in contact with them,
                    let them know you can be available / figure out compensation and make yourself available.</p>
